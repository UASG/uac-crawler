# Introduction:

Universal Acceptance (UA) ensures that all domain names and email addresses can be used by all Internet-enabled applications, devices and systems. 
Universal Acceptance addresses an issue that prevents some Internet users from successfully completing transactions online. The problem can arise when applications reject or don’t treat all parts of the domain name correctly, which can occur if those domain names are longer than three characters (e.g., .photography) or in different languages and scripts (e.g., .рф for “Russia Federation” in the Cyrillic script). Universal Acceptance encompasses the acceptance, validation, processing, storing and displaying of all domain names equally, consistently and correctly.


# Importance of Universal Acceptance

When businesses are UA-ready, their systems and services will work with the continuously expanding domain name space. When a company is UA-ready, email addresses in any script from any domain name can be used. When a site is UA-ready, it will allow customers with domain names in new top-level domains to successfully use the site and its forms.  


# What does the UAC Crawler do? 

The UAC Crawler will enable companies and website owners to find out the complexity involved in making their web assets Universal Acceptance Compliant. The idea behind the UAC Crawler portal is that it will give a complexity score which will help nontechnical user base to get started with the UAC journey. 
The UAC Crawler will crawl the website and generate a list of all internal links - Each use of a link might need to be checked that it can handle UA. It will then generate a score based on how compliant the website links are. The score will be out of 10 and will be based on the following factors: 
* Domain Unicode URL Compliance - Checks if all links are UA compliant. It checks for the HTML encoding of the page to verify if it is UTF compliant. 
* Unicode Email Address Compliance - Checks if all email addresses are UA Compliant 
* Inactive URL Compliance - The tool also checks for inactive or dead links.
